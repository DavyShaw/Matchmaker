Notes for the Research Folder: 
=====================================

Rather than having a mix of research in various files for different
team members, please separate research by topic (including
literature resarch) - add your name at the end of a section, 
so we know who contributed what. 

Suggested Topics: 
====================

1. User Stories & User/Market Research
2. Visualisations/Drawings of User Flow
3. Competitor Apps
4. System Architecture
5. App Development
